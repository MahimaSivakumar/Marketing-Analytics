# Marketing-Analytics

A client of a business consulting company Games Analytics has asked them to prepare a report on the performance
of a computer game (see the group number below to see the name of your game). They are developing a similar game
and want to make a commercial offer to Valve to support their product. Games Analytics have decided to outsource
this project to you. They want you to analyse the behaviour of players, and to predict how many players will be
online in the next two weeks. The latter is needed so that their client can decide whether to purchase additional
servers to support more players online. The company says that the data can be collected from the Steamdb.info
website. They have not collected any external information, but they claim that all the prices and promotions are
freely available online, and they encourage you to collect all the data that you might need for the analysis. They also
think that there might be some other games that exhibit a similar behaviour in terms of online players, but they
leave it up to you to decide, which additional games to include in your analysis if any at all.


In order to help the company,  need to answer the following questions:

1. Do the Twitch views impact the number of players? If yes, how specifically? Should the company encourage
more views on Twitch to attract more customers?
2. Approximately, how many innovators and imitators does the game have (overall)?
3. Is the pricing strategy efficient in terms of attracting players to the game?
4. Is the promotional strategy efficient in terms of attracting players? Should it be changed to have more players
in the next 14 days? If yes, how specifically?
5. What will be the number of players per day in the next 14 days?
